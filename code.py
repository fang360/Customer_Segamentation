# Introduction

Customer segmentation is a vital strategy for businesses looking to allocate their resources efficiently. One of the most popular and effective methods of customer segmentation is RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
RFM analysis is a behaviour-based approach that groups customers into segments based on their past purchase behaviour. It considers three factors: recency, frequency, and monetary value. Using these three factors, RFM analysis categorizes customers into segments and helps businesses identify the most profitable segments.
